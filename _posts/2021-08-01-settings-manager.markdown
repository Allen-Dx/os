Settings Manager is an alternative system settings manager. Added additional system settings that are missing in the original application, also duplicates some settings from the original settings manager that work incorrectly or with errors. The task of the application is to fix incorrect settings and add additional system settings. I plan to develop this settings center and expand the system configurations.
